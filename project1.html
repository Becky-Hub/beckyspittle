                <h1>Leveraging Proxemic Dimensions for Context Aware XR Interaction</h1>

                <p>This project encompasses my PhD research, investigating how proxemic dimensions—distance, orientation, movement, identity, and location—can be leveraged to enhance interactions in XR environments. By exploring the advantages, limitations, and affordances of common interaction techniques in different situations and use cases, this research contributes to the development of more intuitive, adaptive, and contextually aware XR systems that improve user experience, interaction flow, and efficiency. This research aims to help uncover how technology can further enhance user experiences and how we can leverage XR and ML/AI to improve everyday interactions.</p>


                <h2>Project Details</h2>

                <h2>Skills Employed</h2>
                <p>Key skills needed to complete the project were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Research: </b></li>
                    <li><b>Design:</b></li>
                    <li><b>Development:</b></li>
                    <li><b>Analysis:</b></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Future Work</h2>
                <p>The studies conducted have investigated three dimensions of proxemic interaction—distance, orientation and movement—highlighting their impact on XR interaction techniques. My thesis also considers how identity and location can help define the appropriateness of interaction techniques. Identity refers to metadata associated with people and objects within the environment (e.g. real/virtual, user/object as well as their descriptions, such as demographics and preferences, or object shape, colour, size, and level of interactivity). Location relates to environmental and social considerations of the interaction space (e.g. level of noise, size of the space, acceptable behaviours within that space) which inherently impacts technique suitability.</p>

                <p>A number of papers have been prepared as part of the project. A paper titled ``A Review of Interaction Techniques for Immersive Environments'' has been published in IEEE TVCG, with at least two other outputs expected. This notably includes a paper combining study 1 and 2 (targeted venue IJHCI) and a paper reporting on study 3 (targeted venue CHI 2025).</p>
